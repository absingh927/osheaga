### Osheaga Microsite Challenge

#### Background

This project was part of a code challenge to create a microsite to grab bus routes for a specific day. White setting up heroku, I messed up my configuration for the app so had to start in a new repo from scratch. In general really enjoyed doing the project, but could have structed the app better in terms of architecture to be more scalable.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

- `yarn` to install dependencies for the application.
- `yarn start` to launch application. It will automatically open to `localhost:3000`

- Uses Reactstrap compoents to build layout in Bootstrap 4. It uses flexbox!
- The application is mobile friendly.
- JS written in Typescript
- State management powered by Redux
- Implements polling search
